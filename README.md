# toDoListProgram
The repository in which I store my program Code, The first code ever I share.

You must edit the connection string in Form1.cs file to the right SERVER NAME and DATABASE NAME so the application can work when you press the DB button
(apparently any other submitting button)

This code is owned by me and I'm not allowing anyone to just edit it as he wants and saying it is his work, No It will remain my work and my rights should be clear all over it :)
